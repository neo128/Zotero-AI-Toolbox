## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting when available. If private reporting is not available, open an issue with minimal detail and request a private contact channel from maintainers.

Include:

- Affected script(s) and command(s)
- Reproduction steps
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and prioritize fixes based on severity.
